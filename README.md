# PlanetsAPI

A public GraphQL API for information about planets and exoplanets.

## Writing Queries

```
query{
  planet(code:"venus"){
    name
    massKg
    radiusKm
    orbitDays
    semimajorAu
    discoveryMethod
  }
}
```

The above query will produce the following result:

```
{
  "data": {
    "planet": {
      "name": "Venus",
      "massKg": "4.867e+24",
      "radiusKm": "6051.8",
      "orbitDays": "225",
      "semimajorAu": "0.723",
      "discoveryMethod": "telescope"
    }
  }
}
```
